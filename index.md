<blockquote>
Custom static analysis tools ( linters ) enable security engineers to quickly identify, share and automate the detection of common anti-patterns in source code. We'll dive into how to build our own analysis tools for Go by analyzing abstract syntax trees using the go/analysis package. Don't know what any of that means? Honestly, I didn't either a few months ago, but, it's surprisingly simple and applicable to other languages such as Python, Ruby, JavaScript, HCL, YAML, and more.

As usual many of us show up before 5:30pm to grab some food & drink before and socialize. All are welcome to join us anytime before the talk just look for large table meetup or ask the staff where are OWASP or Misec. The talk takes place in a meeting space of the bar so you are welcome grab a beer at the bar and bring it into the talk.
